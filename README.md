## Graphical system overview

#### Diagram explanation can be found in the bottom of README.

## What is it?

When settling on technologies, style and architecture, I spend some time experimenting to find a fit where I will create a sample app - this is that.

Naturally, some of the contents end up not being part of the actual course contents, since I deem they don't fit into the scope, but I might still leave the code in here.

### Try the deployed version:
The current version can be used here: (link coming soon)

## Quickstart: Run Locally

### With Docker and Docker Compose installed:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

### Without docker. With .NET 8 CLI: 
(will use some default environment variables without certain 3rd party services like Azure
Cognitive Services):

```
cd backend/api && dotnet run --rebuild-db
```

## What does it do?

- Demonstration of realtime chat application + live data presentation from IoT edge devices
